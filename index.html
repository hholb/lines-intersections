            <li>1. Click inside the canvas to add a point.</li>
            <li>2. Click inside the canvas again to add a second point. A line segment will connect the points.</li>
            <li>3. Repeat steps one and two to add more line segments. You can add as many line segments as you like.
            </li>
            <li>4. Click the 'Find Intersections' and all intersection points will be calculated and a circle will
                highlight
                the intersections.

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to get some practice with the math for computing lines and intersections using
            linear algebra.</p>
        <p>It is built using HTML Canvas, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript</p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>2 points form a line segment on the canvas.</p>
        <p>Each line segment is represented by its end points.</p>
        <p>When the 'Find Intersections' button is clicked, each line segment is converted to its parametric form.</p>
        <pre><code>
            L1(t) = x1 + t(x2 - x1), L1(t) = y1 + t(y2 - y1)
        </code></pre>
        <p>Then, for each line segment on the canvas we set up a system of equations setting each line segment's
            parametric
            equations
            equal to another line segment's equations.</p>
        <pre><code>
            x1 + t1(x2 - x1) = x3 + t2(x4 - x3)
            y1 + t1(y2 - y1) = y3 + t2(y4 - y3)
        </code></pre>
        <p>This allows us to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of just the end points of each line segment, as well as find
            where they intersect.</p>
        <p>Once we have t1 and t2, we can plug them back into the parametric equations and get a value for t1 and
            t2.</p>
        <p>We then need to check that t1 and t2 are between 0 and 1. If they are not the intersection lies outside the
            line segment.</p>
        <p>With values for t1 and t2 in hand, we can plug them into the equations and find the x and y coordinates of
            the intersection point.</p>
